# Portable control of DNS clouds

Denominator is a portable Java library for manipulating DNS clouds. Denominator has pluggable back-ends, including AWS Route53, Neustar Ultra, DynECT, Rackspace Cloud DNS, OpenStack Designate, and a mock for testing. We also ship a command line version so it's easy for anyone to try it out. Denominator currently supports basic zone and record features, as well GEO (aka Directional) profiles. See [Netflix Tech Blog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/03/denominator-multi-vendor-interface-for.html) for an introduction.

[![Build Status](https://netflixoss.ci.cloudbees.com/job/denominator-master/badge/icon)](https://netflixoss.ci.cloudbees.com/job/denominator-master/)

## Command line
For your convenience, the denominator cli is a [single executable file](http://skife.org/java/unix/2011/06/20/really_executable_jars.html). Under the hood, the cli uses [airline](https://github.com/airlift/airline) to look and feel like dig or git.

## Android
There's no official android client, yet. However, we do have an [Android Example](https://github.com/Netflix/denominator/tree/master/example-android) you can try out.

### Binaries
If you are using OSX, [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) has a built-in installer for denominator.

Here's how to get denominator-cli `4.5.0` from [bintray](https://bintray.com/pkg/show/general/netflixoss/denominator/denominator-cli)

1. [Download denominator](https://bintray.com/artifact/download/netflixoss/maven/com/netflix/denominator/denominator-cli/4.5.0/denominator-cli-4.5.0-fat.jar)
2. Place it on your `$PATH`. (ex. `~/bin`)
3. Set it to be executable. (`chmod 755 ~/bin/denominator`)

### Getting Started

Advanced usage, including ec2 hooks are covered in the [readme](https://github.com/Netflix/denominator/tree/master/cli). Here's a quick start for the impatient.

If you just want to fool around, you can use the `mock` provider.
```bash
# first column is the zone id, which isn't always its name!
$ denominator -p mock zone list
denominator.io.          denominator.io.                                          admin.denominator.io.                86400
$ denominator -p mock record -z denominator.io. list
denominator.io.                                    SOA   3600   ns1.denominator.io. admin.denominator.io. 1 3600 600 604800 60
denominator.io.                                    NS    86400  ns1.denominator.io.
```

Different providers connect to different urls and need different credentials. First step is to run `./denominator providers` to see how many `-c` args you need and what values they should have:

```bash
$ denominator providers
provider   url                                                 duplicateZones credentialType credentialArgs
mock       mem:mock                                            false
clouddns   https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/       true           apiKey         username apiKey
designate  http://localhost:5000/v2.0                          true           password       tenantId username password
dynect     https://api2.dynect.net/REST                        false          password       customer username password
route53    https://route53.amazonaws.com                       true           accessKey      accessKey secretKey
route53    https://route53.amazonaws.com                       true           session        accessKey secretKey sessionToken
ultradns   https://ultra-api.ultradns.com:8443/UltraDNS_WS/v01 false          password       username password
```

Now, you can list your zones or records.

```bash
$ denominator -p ultradns -c my_user -c my_password zone list
--snip--
netflix.com.
--snip--
$ denominator -p ultradns -c my_user -c my_password record --zone netflix.com. list
--snip--
email.netflix.com.                                 A     3600   192.0.2.1
--snip--
```

## Code

Denominator exposes a portable [model](https://github.com/Netflix/denominator/wiki/Models) implemented by pluggable `Provider`s such as `route53`, `ultradns`, `dynect`, `clouddns`, or `mock`. Under the covers, providers are [Dagger](http://square.github.com/dagger/) modules. Except for the mock, all current providers bind to http requests via [feign](https://github.com/Netflix/feign), which keeps the distribution light.

### Binaries

The current version of denominator is `4.5.0`

Denominator can be resolved as maven dependencies, or equivalent in lein, gradle, etc. Here are the coordinates, noting you only need to list the providers you use.
```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.netflix.denominator</groupId>
    <artifactId>denominator-core</artifactId>
    <version>${denominator.version}</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.netflix.denominator</groupId>
    <artifactId>denominator-clouddns</artifactId>
    <version>${denominator.version}</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.netflix.denominator</groupId>
    <artifactId>denominator-dynect</artifactId>
    <version>${denominator.version}</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.netflix.denominator</groupId>
    <artifactId>denominator-route53</artifactId>
    <version>${denominator.version}</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.netflix.denominator</groupId>
    <artifactId>denominator-ultradns</artifactId>
    <version>${denominator.version}</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Getting Started

Creating a connection to a provider requires that you have access to two things: the name of the provider, and as necessary, credentials for it.
```java
import static denominator.CredentialsConfiguration.credentials;
...
DNSApiManager manager = Denominator.create("ultradns", credentials(username, password)); // manager is closeable, so please close it!
```
The credentials are variable length, as certain providers require more that 2 parts. The above returns an instance of `DNSApiManager` where apis such as `ZoneApis` are found. Here's how to list zones: 
```java
for (Zone zone : manager.api().zones()) {
  for (ResourceRecordSet<?> rrs : manager.api().recordSetsInZone(zone.id())) {
    processRRS(rrs);
  }
}
```

If you are running unit tests, or don't have a cloud account yet, you can use mock, and skip the credentials part.
```java
DNSApiManager manager = Denominator.create("mock");
```

The Denominator [model](https://github.com/Netflix/denominator/wiki/Model) is based on the `ResourceRecordSet` concept. A `ResourceRecordSet` is simply a group of records who share the same name and type. For example all address (`A`) records for the name `www.netflix.com.` are aggregated into the same `ResourceRecordSet`. The values of each record in a set are type-specific. These data types are implemented as map-backed interfaces. This affords both the strong typing of java and extensibility and versatility of maps.

For example, the following are identical:
```java
mxData.getPreference();
mxData.get("preference");
```

Resource record sets live in a Zone, which is roughly analogous to a domain. Zones can be created on-demand and deleted.

### Use via Dagger
Some users may wish to use Denominator as a Dagger library. Here's one way to achieve that:
```java
import static denominator.CredentialsConfiguration.credentials;
import static denominator.Dagger.provider;
...
// this shows how to facilitate runtime url updates
Provider fromDiscovery = new UltraDNSProvider() {
  public String url() {
    return discovery.urlFor("ultradns");
  }
};
// this shows how to facilitate runtime credential updates
Supplier<Credentials> fromEncryptedStore = new Supplier<Credentials>() {
  public Credentials get() {
    return encryptedStore.getCredentialsFor("ultradns");
  }
}
DNSApiManager manager = ObjectGraph.create(provider(fromDiscovery), new UltraDNSProvider.Module(), credentials(fromEncryptedStore))
                                   .get(DNSApiManager.java);
```

## Third-Party Providers
Denominator also operates with third-party DNS providers such as [DiscoveryDNS](https://github.com/discoverydns/denominator-discoverydns).

Providers are looked up by name using [ServiceLoader](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html). Given the provider is in the classpath, normal lookups should work.

```java
// Given the discoverydns jar is in the classpath
DNSApiManager manager = Denominator.create("discoverydns");
```

Third-party support is also explained in the [CLI readme](https://github.com/Netflix/denominator/tree/master/cli).
